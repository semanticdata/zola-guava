## Running the Site Locally

Tips that will help you develop and preview the site locally.

### Requirements

Before using the theme, you need to install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) ‚â• 0.18.0.

### Quick Start

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:semanticdata/zola-guava.git
# change directory into the cloned folder
cd zola-guava
# serve the site locally
zola serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

For more detailed instructions, visit the [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) page about installing and using themes.

### Useful Commands

A short list of commands that will help you develop your own version of the theme.

| Command                    | Description                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `zola init <my-repo>`      | Initiate new Zola site     |
| `zola build`               | Build only                 |
| `zola serve`               | Build and Serve            |

## Customization

You can changed the configuration, templates and content yourself. Refer to the `config.toml`, and templates files for ideas. In most cases you only need to modify the contents of `config.toml` to customize the appearance of your blog. Make sure to visit tyhe [Zola Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).

### Custom CSS Styles

Adding custom CSS is as easy as adding your styles to `sass/_custom.scss`. This is made possible because SCSS files are backwards compatible with CSS. This means you can type normal CSS code into a SCSS file and it will be valid.
