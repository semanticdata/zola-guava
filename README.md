## Introduction

Originally this repository was meant to help test new Zola workflows and deployments. Now it only serves as inspiration for web design as I no longer plan to actively develop it.

## Features

Zola Dinkleberg is based on [rust-br/dinkleberg](https://github.com/rust-br/dinkleberg). The aim of the project is to revive what is a beautiful theme. That said, I have added the following:

* Refactored color styles. Makes it easier to cusotmize the site.
* Made different Typography choices. Big change to `line height`.
* Justified post contents without affecting titles.
* Fixed codeblocks line height and border issues.
* Changed code highlighting theme to `zenburn`.
* Added additional nav section for external *Links* alongside *Social* links.
* Addressed Issue [#2](https://github.com/rust-br/dinkleberg/issues/2). Fixed mobile version. No longer broken.
* Addressed Issue [#12](https://github.com/rust-br/dinkleberg/issues/12). Fixed `config.toml` by adding `label_minutes`. Would not build before.
* Addressed Issue [#13](https://github.com/rust-br/dinkleberg/issues/13). Fixed code padding.

## Running the Site Locally

Tips that will help you develop and preview the site locally.

### Requirements

Before using the theme, you need to install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) ≥ 0.18.0.

### Quick Start

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:semanticdata/mabuya.git
# change directory into the cloned folder
cd mabuya
# serve the site locally
zola serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

For more detailed instructions, visit the [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) page about installing and using themes.

### Useful Commands

A short list of commands that will help you develop your own version of the theme.

| Command                    | Description                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `zola init <my-repo>`      | Initiate new Zola site     |
| `zola build`               | Build only                 |
| `zola serve`               | Build and Serve            |

## Customization

You can changed the configuration, templates and content yourself. Refer to the `config.toml`, and templates files for ideas. In most cases you only need to modify the contents of `config.toml` to customize the appearance of your blog. Make sure to visit tyhe [Zola Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).

### Custom CSS Styles

Adding custom CSS is as easy as adding your styles to `sass/_custom.scss`. This is made possible because SCSS files are backwards compatible with CSS. This means you can type normal CSS code into a SCSS file and it will be valid.
